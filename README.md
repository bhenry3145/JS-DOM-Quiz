Peer Review: Everything works like it is suppose to. just remeber to pay attention to the ids and classes a couple of the elements already had ids on them. I would recommend adding a way to make it not case sensitive. Try not to add console.logs as the part that a user is actually suppose to use as the user will not be able to find it without knowing to go it inspect.
